# HotelSearch

HotelSearch is a project developed for an Information Retrieval course at the [Universit√† della Svizzera Italiana](https://www.usi.ch/en). It is a search engine specifically made for hotels in Spain, Italy, France, Switzerland, Austria, Germany, United Kingdom.

It was developed using:

- [Nutch](http://nutch.apache.org/), to crawl the websites
- [Solr](https://lucene.apache.org/solr/), to do the actual search
- [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial), to display the top 20 results on a map
